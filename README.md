# Pick-Up-Sports

Pick-Up-Sports is a web application using Google App
Engine. Users who are logged in with their Google account can create content (location reports) containing a name, address, 
the sports theme the location falls under, tags that describe the location, and an image. All of the data is stored in
App Engine's Datastore, and the images were stored in GAE's Cloud Storage buckets.
